Tue Sep 15 17:24:26 2020 -0600: asterisk-chan_usbradio: Add txoffdelay
"txoffdelay" ignores the reciever for a specified number of 20 millisecond
intervals after the transmitter unkeys.
This is useful when setting up a half-duplex link with an existing
repeater, where you need to ignore the repeater's hangtime.

Sun Aug 30 13:52:04 2020 -0600: update-fail2ban: Make sure the default RasLink rules are loaded from'00raslink.local'
If Fail2ban isn't running after the new rules are installed, it will be started.

Sun Aug 30 11:39:16 2020 -0600: asterisk-app_rpt: Bump module version to 20.09

Wed Aug 26 02:36:44 2020 -0600: bugfix: required-tools: Make sure "deb-src" sources are available
If a user tried to install RasLink on a Debian-based system (such as Ubuntu), the "deb-src" source repositories were not always loaded properly by 'required-tools'.

Tue Aug 25 21:21:22 2020 -0600: fail2ban: Add 'jail.local'
'jail.local' is used to load user customizable rules for Fail2Ban.
Users can add jails to this file that are not already loaded by </etc/fail2ban/jail.d/00raslink.local>.
'jail.local' includes examples useful for users of Allmon.

Tue Aug 25 15:10:51 2020 -0600: fail2ban: Add comment describing how '00raslink.local' is used

Tue Aug 25 14:17:13 2020 -0600: fail2ban: Disable '[mysqld-auth]' jail
By default, RasLink doesn't use any mysql databases.
The '[mysqld-auth]' jail is used to block attacks against the mysql server.
If a user installes Allmon, and wants to enable '[mysqld-auth]', the user should edit
</etc/fail2ban/jail.local>.

Tue Aug 25 12:53:26 2020 -0600: fail2ban: Use 'banaction_allports' for the action to take when banning
When an attacker is banned, they should be banned on all ports,
not just the port they tried to access.
If the ssh port is changed from the default (22),
the RasLink Fail2Ban rules should not assume that the active ssh port will
always be the port defined in
</etc/services>.

Tue Aug 25 12:08:23 2020 -0600: fail2ban: Rename 'jail.local' to '00raslink.local'
The default RasLink rules for Fail2Ban are loaded from this file.
Users should not edit this file.

'00raslink.local' is stored in and loaded from
</etc/fail2ban/jail.d>.

Thu Jul 30 14:57:52 2020 -0600: Security: Add Fail2Ban
Fail2Ban is used to block brute force attackers from gaining access to RasLink.
Users have 6 (six) attempts to send the correct login information to RasLink.
If the user doesn't send the correct login information within 6 (six) attempts, the user will be banned for 2 (two) hours.
After 2 (two) hours, if repeated failed login attempts continue from the same IP address, the user/attacker will be banned for up to 1 (one) week.
To regain access to RasLink if the user gets banned, the user should fill in the 'Contact Us' form, located at:
https://jlappliedtechnologies.com/contact-us/
When filling in the form, the user should request to have their IP address unbanned.
